Notes App is a universal app that allows you to write and leave notes, edit and delete them!

Note: All the notes you enter will be saved in the local storage of your device.

I did this practice following the steps given by Ernest Achiever in his Youtube tutorial [React Notes App Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3ooazcK4TI&t=4858s). This is the result of his tutorial:

## 📃 In the application you can:

- Create notes ✅
- Edit the notes that have been created ✅
- Delete existing notes ✅
- Search for a specific note ✅

## ⚙️ Changes made:

- To make this application I decided to do it with React but with TypeScript and not with JavaScript. Working with TypeScript allowed me to practice with this language, being quite a challenge when having to type the props.
- I decided to make the application fully responsive, because in the tutorial the app would only look good on mobile but on desktop it would not take advantage of all the space on the screen.
